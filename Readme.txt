How to play: Spoiler Alert! When the game starts, the main character called Eve stands up from the ground and found herself trapped inside a horrific room. 
The dialog box would show up and display some background information. The goal is to get Eve out of the scary place. You would use "WASD" or arrow keys 
to move Eve to explore the house. On the table nearby, there is a note whose corner is torn part. You have to find the torn part to obtain the next 
clue. Move Eve to the door and press O to open it. The next lead is inside the trash bin beside the door. This lead is a decoded message. There are twelve 
characters, comprised of eleven X and one O, respectively representing twelve drawers on the wall. Move Eve close to the drawer , where its position 
corresponds to the position of O, and open it to release a cat that has a key hanging on it. You have to figure out how to obtain the key. Move Eve close to 
the chest, and open it to get cat food. Put cat food into the bowl at the corner of the room to attract the cat. When the cat is eating the food, you can catch
it and obtain the key.  Using the key, Eve can finally unlock the other door and escape!

 
3. Known Problem Areas:
1. When Eve is too close to a wall, the camera could look through the wall and see objects behind it.
2. Ceillings are not able to block directional light.
